# Testing REST

Besides the above described general instructions for requesting data, Ultimo is able to generate key specific [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) documentation. Swagger documentation contains all commands that can be executed in the API connection, including options to try it out. It is specific to the key, as it generates content based on the configuration of the API key. Another possibility to test the REST API is by using [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).
