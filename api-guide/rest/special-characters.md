# Special characters

Some special characters can't be directly used in requests. This paragraph explains all limitations and how to work around them.

* You can't use a forward slashes for the Id in the route, because it will be interpreted as a path separator: //ERROR GET [http://customer.ultimo.com/api/v1/object/Building\('01/02'\)](http://customer.ultimo.com/api/v1/object/Building%28)
* Using URL encoding also won't work because WebAPI will URL decode it first and it will result in the same URL: //ERROR GET [http://customer.ultimo.com/api/v1/object/Building\('01%2f02'\)](http://customer.ultimo.com/api/v1/object/Building%28)
* It is possible to use a forward slash in the Id when using a filter: //GOOD GET [http://customer.ultimo.com/api/v1/object/Building?filter=Id](http://customer.ultimo.com/api/v1/object/Building?filter=Id) eq '01/02'

The following special characters also can't be used in the Id, because ASP.NET will give a warning about a potentially dangerous request path value:  
&lt; &gt; \* % & : \ ?  
The detection of these special characters can be disabled but that might be a potential security issue.

* It is possible to use these special characters in a filter when properly URL encoded: //BAD GET [http://customer.ultimo.com/api/v1/object](http://customer.ultimo.com/api/v1/object) /Building?filter=Id eq '&lt;&gt;\*%&:\?' //GOOD GET [http://customer.ultimo.com/api/v1/object](http://customer.ultimo.com/api/v1/object) /Building?filter=Id+eq+'%3C%3E\*%25%26%3A%3F'
* Other special characters can be used in the Id when properly URL encoded: //BAD GET [http://customer.ultimo.com/api/v1/object](http://customer.ultimo.com/api/v1/object) /Building\('$+,;=@ "{}!^~\[\]\`'\) //GOOD GET [http://customer.ultimo.com/api/v1/object](http://customer.ultimo.com/api/v1/object) /Building\('$+,;=@%20%22%7B%7D!%5E~%5B%5D%60'\)

Single quotes inside strings used in a filter expression need to be escaped using two single quotes:

* GET [http://customer.ultimo.com/api/v1/object](http://customer.ultimo.com/api/v1/object) /Building?filter=Description eq 'single''quote'
