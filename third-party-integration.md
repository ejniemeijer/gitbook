### Connecting to third party web services

Ultimo Business Integration is able to connect with third party web services. Both import and export connectors offer the possibility to send requests to a webservice url. By default, the request will be send in a fixed Ultimo format. It is however possible to send data in a specified custom \(xml or json\) file format. This can be configured by our consultants.

Ultimo Business Integration is also able to connect with web services that require a Expect: 100-continue header in the initial request.

#### Authentication options

The following authentication types are supported when connecting to third party web services:

* Basic authentication
* [OAuth2.0](https://oauth.net/2/)
  * Ultimo offers support for grant types Authorization code, Password and Client credentials
