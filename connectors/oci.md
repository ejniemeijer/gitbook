Open Catalog Interface \(OCI\) is one of the standard formats used when connecting to external punch-out catalogs. The OCI format is used to define the field mapping between the supplier's catalog and Ultimo, to ensure that the data is transferred accurately and completely between source and receiver. Note that only the content of the shopping card is exchanged, the interface does not include online ordering or article synchronisation. 

With the OCI connecter in Ultimo it is possible to define the field mapping and configure what should happen with the received content of the shopping cart. For example: creating order request lines or a draft order. It is also possible to trigger additional \(custom\) business logic.

Ultimo does not offer standard OCI connectors, only generic tooling to configure these interfaces is available. Each OCI interface has to be configured specifically by a consultant.

### Technical details

Specific documentation for a supplier's catalog should be available through the supplier. Ultimo is able to connect to any webshop compliant to the OCI 5.0 standard. Sending an HTTP request can be done using either a GET or POST method.
