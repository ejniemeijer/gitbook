# Software editions

In our editions, we offer various integration options. Ultimo Essentials, as well as all other versions, offers default integrated e-mail communication. Starting from Ultimo Professional, you can use various default integrations, including customer-specific ones.

If you need more complex interfaces, for example to trigger customer-specific actions, Ultimo Premium has everything you need. Ultimo Premium and Enterprise enable the configuration of more specific workflows for integrations. This makes it possible to trigger actions in Ultimo using REST API or to trigger interfaces after executing an action in Ultimo. It is also possible to realise more specific batch import and export interfaces with other parties through the available Ultimo Business Integration connectors.
