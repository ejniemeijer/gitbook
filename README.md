Ultimo offers seamless integration with other applications. Thanks to a modern integration platform, certified standard interfaces and ready-to-use connectors, you receive and send the right data at the right time, and with the right quality. Integration is easy to realise and is robust and maintainable. With smart integration, you reduce manual input, guaranteeing the integrity of data and ensuring that your decisions are based on current information.

In our editions, we offer various integration options. Ultimo Essentials, as well as all other versions, offers default integrated e-mail communication. Starting from Ultimo Professional, you can use various default integrations, including customer-specific ones. Ultimo Professional uses Ultimo REST API which makes it possible to request data from Ultimo. In addition, it is possible to realise batch imports and exports by using default Ultimo Business Integration connectors.

If you need more complex interfaces, for example to trigger customer-specific actions, Ultimo Premium has everything you need. Ultimo Premium and Enterprise enable the configuration of more specific workflows for integrations. This makes it possible to trigger actions in Ultimo using REST API or to trigger interfaces after executing an action in Ultimo. It is also possible to realise more specific batch import and export interfaces with other parties through the available Ultimo Business Integration connectors.

We have extensive experience of realising and maintaining interfaces ranging from Enterprise Resource Planning \(ERP\) and Geographical Information System \(GIS\) to external data sources, IoT platforms and Augmented Reality.
